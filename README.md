# Introduction
My name is Bunmi Akapo and this is my first commit.

# Learning Software Engineering
I am a student of [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) and I am currently learning about software engineering. In this module, I am focusing on the basics of:
- Git
- Github
- Emacs
- Vim

## Git
Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code and collaborate with others. It is widely used in the software industry and is a crucial tool for any developer to know.

## Github
Github is a web-based platform that uses git for version control and provides a place for developers to host and share their code. It is also a great place for developers to collaborate on open-source projects.

## Emacs
Emacs is a text editor that has been around for many years and is widely used by programmers. It is known for its powerful customization options and is often used by developers who prefer to have a high level of control over their text editor.

## Vim
Vim is another popular text editor, known for its efficiency and speed. It is often used by developers who prefer to have a minimalistic interface and use keyboard shortcuts to navigate and edit text.
